Defining Names
==============

Often we need to define some unique names to distinguish virtual
machines or other objects that we use as part of our programming.
Besisdes uuid that is provided byt pythin cloudmesh ahs additional
functions that simplify name generation.

UUIDs
-----

UUIDs are provided as part of the pythin standard libraries. There are a
number of different initializations and which to uuse depends on your
needs.

                from uuid import uuid1
                
.. code:: python

    import uuid
Machine dependent uuid
----------------------

One of them is to create UUIDs dependent on your machine name with
uuid1.

.. code:: python

    uuid.uuid1()



.. parsed-literal::

    UUID('f040aaf5-3242-11e4-bd35-600308a5f9d2')



Random Uuid
-----------

uuid4 creates random uuids.

.. code:: python

    uuid.uuid4()



.. parsed-literal::

    UUID('ac332de1-faef-4054-aae8-6f32eb15f982')



As in some cases we want to generate names that do not include special
characters such as - or . we avoid using the uuid function for now and
use the function get\_unique\_name instaed.

.. code:: python

    uuid.UUID(bytes=uuid.uuid4().bytes)



.. parsed-literal::

    UUID('e529ec9c-e40d-4e3b-b4db-4b46802bd4f6')



.. code:: python

    uuid.uuid4().int



.. parsed-literal::

    64005057163216856052777834181321712834L



Cloudmesh get\_unique\_name
---------------------------

Sometimes it is beneficial to create uuids without the - in it. For this
we have a convenience function in cloudmesh.

.. code:: python

    from cloudmesh_common.util import get_unique_name
.. code:: python

    print get_unique_name()

.. parsed-literal::

    f04729ee324211e49889600308a5f9d2


As you can see it is just like the uuid function (currently uuid1 with
the - removed.

In addition one can place a prefix into the uuid to make furher
distinctions. However this is rarely needed.

.. code:: python

    get_unique_name("gregor")



.. parsed-literal::

    'gregorf0487de3324211e4b177600308a5f9d2'



Generating VM names
-------------------

To create a name for a virtual machine we often recommend to use a
prefix with a number for an identifier of the virtual machine. This will
come in handy when we need to start multile virtual machines and
distinguish them with a different name. CLoudmesh uses internally by
using your username from the FutureGrid portal as defined in the
cloudmesh.yaml file.

.. code:: python

    import cloudmesh
.. code:: python

    print cloudmesh.vm_name("gregor", 1)

.. parsed-literal::

    gregor-00001
