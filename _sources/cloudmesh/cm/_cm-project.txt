``project`` Command in Cloudmesh ``cm``
=======================================

The ``project`` command provides a list of default, active, or completed
project fo a given user. You can update the project information with
this command.

..note:: that all your ``project`` command executions update your yaml
file (cloudmesh.yaml) and mongo db (user, defaults) both.

IPython Alias
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the alias command we simply define a new command with the name cm
that we can call directly from IPython. Here we make sure that the
parameters ar between "" so that they are properly set. Just execute the
following lines.

.. code:: python

    alias cm cm %s
We are using now one of the methods to call the cm commands in the
following sections.

``project info`` Command
------------------------

The ``project`` command has a number of options that are useful to
manage a list of projects. The ``info`` option provides a current
information on your account.

.. code:: python

    cm project info

.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg20
      projects: fg20, fg82
     completed: fg130
    


Set a default project
---------------------

``project default [project name]`` allows you to update a default
project to your account.

.. code:: python

    cm project default fg82

.. parsed-literal::

    CM ... site/cloudmesh-1.0-py2.7.egg/cloudmesh_cmd3/plugins/cm_shell_project.pyc:58:   INFO - sets the default project
    CM ... site/cloudmesh-1.0-py2.7.egg/cloudmesh_cmd3/plugins/cm_shell_project.pyc:70:   INFO - fg82 project is a default project now
    fg82 project is a default project now


.. code:: python

    cm project

.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg82
      projects: fg20, fg82
     completed: fg130
    


You can see your default project has been changed from fg20 to fg82.
Note that ``cm project`` is same command with ``cm project info``.
``info`` option can be suppressed.

Set an active project
---------------------

You can add a project to your account as one of the active projects. You
can have multiple projects in your active project list.

.. code:: python

    cm project active fg415

.. parsed-literal::

    CM ... site/cloudmesh-1.0-py2.7.egg/cloudmesh_cmd3/plugins/cm_shell_project.pyc:75:   INFO - Sets the active project
    CM ... site/cloudmesh-1.0-py2.7.egg/cloudmesh_cmd3/plugins/cm_shell_project.pyc:83:   INFO - fg415 project is an active project(s) now
    fg415 project is an active project(s) now


.. code:: python

    cm project info

.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg82
      projects: fg20, fg82, fg415
     completed: fg130
    


You can see the new project ``fg415`` added to the active projects.

Change the status of project to ``completed``
---------------------------------------------

If your project is completed and no longer needed, you may want to
change the status from active to completed. ``completed`` option allows
to change the status of the selected project.

.. code:: python

    cm project completed fg415

.. parsed-literal::

    CM ... site/cloudmesh-1.0-py2.7.egg/cloudmesh_cmd3/plugins/cm_shell_project.pyc:115:   INFO - Sets a completed project
    CM ... site/cloudmesh-1.0-py2.7.egg/cloudmesh_cmd3/plugins/cm_shell_project.pyc:126:   INFO - fg415 project is in a completed project(s)
    fg415 project is in a completed project(s)


.. code:: python

    cm project 

.. parsed-literal::

    
    Project Information
    -------------------
    
       default: fg82
      projects: fg20, fg82
     completed: fg130, fg415

Future Extensions
-----------------

.. todo:: Hyungro, please proovide an extension to this function to
allow adding and deleting of projects.

.. code:: python

    cm project add fg455
                cm project delete fg455
                
Adding and deletion of projects may need to be done carefully. We do not
want t o add projects you are not member of. It would be important to
add some test if possible. The --force flag forces the addition and
deletion without test.

.. todo:: Hyungro, please add the --format=FORMAT flag to print the
output in json and a table.
